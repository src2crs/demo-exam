# Src2Crs-Demo: Exams

This repo contains an example of how a programming assignment could look like,
and how Src2Crs or its related tools can be used to process it.
The example consists of the following folders:

* [`task1`](task1):
  * [`task.go`](task1/task.go):  
    Source file with the task description and a solution.  
    The students are be given a version of that file that doesn't contain the solution.
  * [`task_test.go`](task1/task_test.go):  
    Contains tests in `Example` form that are also given to the students.
